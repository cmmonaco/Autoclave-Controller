# Autoclave Controller

## Autoclave Controller

This is the source for a simple controller that monitors and maintains a specified pressure. It displays the current pressure, set point, and start/stop options.

## Autoclave Controller Plus

This is a more sophisticated version that includes automated timing control and a nicer interface. It is **incomplete**. I may revisit this version later if there's time.
